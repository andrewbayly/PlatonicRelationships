- PROTOTYPE - make a tetrahedron
  - create cylinders and move them around! - DONE!
  - create edges as cylinders so that we can have a tetra-hedron - DONE!
  - write function which transforms an edge into the right location between two points. DONE!
  - make a tetrahedron! - DONE
- make an MPoly, with Vertex, MVertex, and Edge arrays. - DONE
- display three prototype MPoly's and switch between them. - DONE!
- create Matrix classes

    - Rotation Matrix - DONE
    - Reflection Matrix - DONE
    - Combine Matrix with another Matrix
  - Vector - DONE
    - Apply Matrix - DONE
  - reflect vector X in plane made by vectors P and Q - DONE!
  - normalize a vector ( to length 1 ) - DONE
  
- write MPoly generator - takes three Vertices, and generates an MPoly - DONE
- create primary triangles for: - DONE!
  - tetrahedral - DONE!
  - octahedral - DONE!
  - icosahedral - DONE!
- create proper MPolys for three symmetries. - DONE! 
- create MPoly generator for snub MPoly's
- create 3 additional (snub) MPoly's
- integrate snub MPoly's into the visualizer

- tune width of bars so we can see the solids more clearly - DONE!

- re-org the code: 
  - pop out 
     MPoly
     Vector 
     Matrix
  - change pr to index
  - move 3rd party dependencies into lib directory
  - move this list into TODO.txt
  - tidy up and add doco
- add tests for Matrix and Vector
